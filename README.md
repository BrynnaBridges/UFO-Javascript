## Project Description
​
In order to create this site, I first built a landing page using HTML and CSS to design and build the index.html. I placed a free image from NASA of the Earth to make the webpage more visually appealing. Then I created the data table frame in HTML and brought it onto the page using Javascript and D3 coding. Within the code, I created a search bar that is capable of filtering through every column in the dataset for matching information. That means if a user searches with date, shape, duration, city, state, country, or comments information, the matching sightings will be presented to them.
